### Bug Fixes

#### Critical Settings Save Issue
- **Settings Not Persisting After Master Password Verification**: Fixed critical bug where settings changes were lost after master password verification
  - **Root Cause**: The `pendingAction` variable was being cleared too early in the master password verification flow, causing the actual save operation to be skipped
  - **Symptoms**: Users could change PIN, unlock duration, or other settings, verify their master password successfully, but changes wouldn't actually be saved
  - **Impact**: Most notably affected PIN changes - users would set a new PIN like "12345" but the old PIN would still be required for app unlocking
  - **Resolution**: Fixed the timing issue in `hideMasterPasswordModal()` function to preserve the pending action until after execution
  - **Verification**: Added comprehensive debugging throughout the settings save process to ensure proper execution flow

#### Settings Form Population
- **Settings Form Not Loading Current Values**: Fixed issue where settings form fields were empty on app startup
  - **Issue**: The `loadSettingsForm()` function existed but was only called when switching to settings tab, not during initial app load
  - **Result**: Users saw empty form fields even when settings were properly saved, leading to confusion about current configuration
  - **Fix**: Added `loadSettingsForm()` call to the main `render()` function to ensure settings are always displayed correctly
  - **Improvement**: Settings form now properly shows current values on app startup and after saving changes

### Breaking Changes
- **PIN Required for Stop**: Users can no longer stop monitoring without entering their PIN
  - This change enhances security by preventing unauthorized disabling of monitoring
  - Existing users will notice the new PIN requirement immediately upon updating
  - This affects both manual stop requests and any automated stopping (except scheduled)
  - If wanted, this setting can be turned off through settings

### Migration Notes
- **Automatic Migration**: All new settings have sensible defaults and require no user action
- **Existing Schedules**: Users upgrading will have scheduled monitoring disabled by default
- **Auto-restart**: Enabled by default but only triggers after unexpected shutdowns
- **Settings Preservation**: All existing settings (PIN, unlock duration, etc.) are preserved
